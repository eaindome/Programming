**<ins>Redis Cache Module Documentation</ins>**

**Overview**
This module handles the connection and interaction with a Redis server for caching purposes. It is built using the redis package and is designed to be easily integrated into a Node.js application. The module includes connection handling, error management, and basic Redis operations.

**Code Structure**
The module is structured to initialize a Redis client, manage its connection lifecycle, and provide basic operations to test the connection.

**Dependencies**
The module requires the redis package, which can be installed using npm:
*npm install redis*

**Configuration**
The Redis client is configured to connect to a Redis server running on localhost at port 6379. You can adjust these settings according to your Redis server configuration.

**Events**
The module listens to the following Redis client events:
- connect: Triggered when the client successfully connects to the Redis server.
- ready: Triggered when the client is connected and ready to use.
- error: Triggered when an error occurs.
- end: Triggered when the client is disconnected from the Redis server.

**Connection Management**
The module includes a connectRedis function to connect the Redis client and a signal handler to gracefully close the connection on process termination.

**Usage**
To use this Redis cache module in your project, you can require it in your application files:
*const redisClient = require('./path/to/project.cache.redis.js');*

Ensure that the Redis server is running and accessible at the configured host and port. The module will automatically attempt to connect when it is required.

**Testing Redis Operations**
Upon successful connection, the module will perform a basic set and get operation to verify the connection:

- Set a test key-value pair (test-key: test-value)
- Retrieve the value of the test key

These operations are logged to the console to confirm the successful interaction with the Redis server.

**Handling Process Termination**
The module listens for the SIGINT signal to gracefully close the Redis client connection when the process is terminated (e.g., using Ctrl+C). This ensures that the Redis connection is properly closed, preventing potential issues with hanging connections.

**Error Handling**
The module includes basic error handling for connection and Redis operations. Errors are logged to the console for debugging purposes. Ensure to review and handle these errors appropriately in a production environment.

**Conclusion**
This Redis cache module provides a simple and modular way to integrate Redis caching into your Node.js application. By handling connection management, testing basic operations, and providing graceful shutdown, it ensures a robust interaction with the Redis server. Adjust the configuration and error handling as needed for your specific use case.
