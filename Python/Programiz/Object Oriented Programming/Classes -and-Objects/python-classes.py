# Python Classes
'''
A class is considered as a blueprint of objects. 
We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. 
It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. 
Based on these descriptions we build the house. 
House is the object.
Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.
