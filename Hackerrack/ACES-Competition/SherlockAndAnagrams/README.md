This Python script finds the number of anagram pairs in all substrings of a given string.

The script works as follows:

It starts with an input string s.

It converts the string into a list of characters.

It generates all possible substrings of the input string.

It sorts the characters in each substring. This is done because two strings are anagrams of each other if and only if their sorted strings are equal.

It counts the number of anagram pairs among the sorted substrings. Two substrings are considered an anagram pair if their sorted strings are equal.

Finally, it prints the total number of anagram pairs.

To run the script, simply execute it with a Python interpreter. The input string is currently hardcoded in the script, so to use a different string, you'll need to modify the s variable.
